## Project Description
This project is designed to assist sales representatives in efficiently managing their customer interactions via WhatsApp. The WhatsApp Bot automates responses, tracks customer queries, and streamlines communication, enabling sales teams to focus on closing deals and enhancing customer relationships. The bot's responses are based on data about the products being sold, which is provided by the seller.

## Features

1. Automated responses: The bot can provide instant replies to common customer inquiries, ensuring prompt communication.
2. Customer Query Tracking: All customer interactions are logged and tracked, making it easy to follow up on leads and maintain a history of conversations.
3. Triggers: The bot can be configured with custom triggers to automate specific actions based on keywords or phrases in customer messages. These actions include sending a message to a Telegram channel for sellers with information about the encountered trigger and the customer.
4. Product Data Integration: Bot responses are tailored based on the product data provided by the seller, ensuring accurate and relevant information is shared with customers.
5. Bot Customization: The bot's behavior, greeting message, and triggers can be customized to meet the specific needs of different sales teams and products.

2. The Refresh Page allows the bot to resume interaction with a customer after encountering a trigger. When the bot detects a trigger in the conversation, it sends a default message and stops responding to the customer. By using the Refresh Page, sellers can re-enable the bot's functionality for that particular customer, ensuring continuous and effective communication.
